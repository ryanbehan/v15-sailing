# Vanguard 15 Rigging Manual

This guide covers the unpacking, assembly, and rigging of the Vanguard 15. Whether you have a classic Vanguard-built hull or a newer LaserPerformance model, these instructions will get you on the water safely.

## 1. Preparation

### Tools Needed
*   White electrical tape
*   2 adjustable wrenches and/or pliers

### Unpacking
Unpack the major parts and lay them out on a soft surface (grass or carpet) to avoid scratching the gelcoat.
*   **Hull**
*   **Mast Kit:** Rigged mast, rigged boom.
*   **Boat Kit:** Tiller/Hiking Stick, Daggerboard, Rudder.
*   **Line Bag:** Jib sheet, Mainsheet, Daggerboard shockcord.

> [!TIP]
> All lines provided are long enough for maximum purchase. You may customize lengths later, but be sure to cut and burn ends to prevent fraying.

## 2. Assembly & Rigging

### Daggerboard Shockcord
Locate the daggerboard shockcord in the line bag. Attach each end to the eyestraps that secure the forward end of the hiking straps. Make sure your knots are very tight; shockcord unties easily.

### Assembling the Mast
The mast comes rigged except for the spreaders.
1.  **Prepare:** Remove tape and untie halyards. Secure them loosely so they aren't lost.
2.  **Check Halyard:** Ensure the **main halyard** (aft side of masthead) is **aft** of the spreader brackets. All other rigging should be forward.
3.  **Install Spreaders:**
    *   Slide the end with two holes into the mast brackets (thin edge facing aft).
    *   Install clevis pins and cotter rings.
    *   **Tape:** Tape over the cotter rings to prevent snagging sails.
4.  **Attach Shrouds:**
    *   Remove the pin from the outboard end of the spreader.
    *   Place the shroud into the spreader tip.
    *   Reinsert the pin and clip.
    *   **Verify:** Ensure no rigging is trapped between the shroud and spreader.

### Stepping the Mast
*Two people are recommended.*
1.  **Check Overhead:** **LOOK UP!** Ensure there are no power lines.
2.  **Lift:** Place the mast heel against a solid object (or have a helper hold it). Walk the mast up hand-over-hand.
3.  **Rotate:** Ensure the track faces the stern.
4.  **Step:** Lift the mast high and guide the heel onto the deck step. Align the slot with the pin.
5.  **Attach Shrouds:**
    *   Helper holds the mast.
    *   Attach the shrouds to the chainplates using the pins/adjusters.
6.  **Attach Headstay:** Lean the mast forward against the shrouds and shackle the headstay to the bow fitting. Tighten just enough to keep the mast up; the jib halyard will provide the real tension.

### Rigging the Boom
1.  **Gooseneck:** Attach the forward end of the boom to the gooseneck on the mast using the fast pin.
2.  **Mainsheet Bridle:**
    *   Pass the thick end of the mainsheet through the boom blocks and down to the ratchet block.
    *   Attach the thinner bridle ends to the eyestraps on the stern deck.
    *   **Adjust:** Center the mainsheet splice on the centerline for best performance.
3.  **Vang:** Shackle the vang block to the bail on the underside of the boom.

## 3. Sail Controls

### Jib
1.  **Tack:** Pin the jib tack to the bow fitting (aft of the headstay).
2.  **Sheets:** Find the middle of the jib sheet. Pass it through the clew grommet and loop the tails through it (cow hitch). Lead sheets back to the fairleads.
3.  **Halyard:** Attach the shackle to the head. Hoist.
    *   **Tension:** The jib halyard replaces the headstay for tension. Hook the purchase system into the wire loop near the deck and tension the rig. The headstay should go slack.

### Mainsail
1.  **Battens:** Install the top batten (thin end first).
2.  **Clew:** Slide the clew slug into the boom track.
3.  **Tack:** Pin the tack to the gooseneck.
4.  **Hoist:** Attach the main halyard and hoist. Feed the luff rope into the track.
5.  **Cunningham:** Run the line from the port side of the mast, up through the sail grommet, and down to the starboard cleat.
6.  **Outhaul:** Run from the boom end, through the clew, back to the boom end, and forward to the cleat.

## 4. Launching

*   **Rudder:** Attach to gudgeons. Ensure the retaining clip clicks into place.
*   **Daggerboard:** Slide into the trunk. Use the shockcord to hold it up/down.
*   **Drain Plugs:** **CHECK THEM!**

## 5. Care & Maintenance
*   **Rinse:** Always rinse the boat and hardware with fresh water after sailing in salt water.
*   **Dry:** Let sails dry before rolling.
*   **Cover:** Use a top cover to protect from UV damage.
*   **Trailers:** Don't support the hull on rollers; use bunks to spread the load.

> [!WARNING]
> **Towing:** Do not tow the V15 at high speeds (max 6 knots). Hull damage from high-speed towing is not covered by warranty.
