# Let Loose and Plane Upwind

**By Pete Spaulding**

One of the most thrilling things about the Vanguard 15 is its ability to go fast all around the course. While planing is usually associated with sailing downwind, it's a powerful technique for upwind legs as well. Master this, and you'll beat the fleet to the windward mark while having way more fun.

## Conditions for Planing
To plane efficiently upwind, you generally need:
*   **Flat Water:** 12+ knots of breeze.
*   **Chop:** Closer to 15+ knots.

Below these speeds, you'll have to reach too low to plane, sacrificing VMG (Velocity Made Good). You also need strong legs—once you start planing, you can't stop hiking!

## 1. Rig Set-Up
Planing requires **power**.
*   **Don't Over-Depower:** If you rake back too much to keep the boat flat, you lose the punch needed to plane.
*   **Drop Pins:** If your vang, cunningham, and outhaul are maxed and you're still easing the main more than 6 inches to stay flat, drop a rig pin.
*   **The Goal:** You want to be powered up enough to plane without easing the main more than 6 inches or the jib more than 1.5 inches.

## 2. Sail and Boat Trim
Once your rig is set, it's time to accelerate.
1.  **Bear Away:** Drop the bow 2-5 degrees to build speed.
2.  **Stay Flat:** The boat must remain perfectly flat. Any heel creates windward helm (drag) and risks stalling the rudder.
3.  **Ease Sheets:**
    *   **Jib:** Ease about 2 inches to open the slot.
    *   **Main:** Ease about 6 inches simultaneously.
4.  **Accelerate & Point:** As the boat pops onto a plane, slowly trim both sails back in and head up slightly.
5.  **Steer with Sails:** Use your mainsheet to steer over waves (main in to head up, main out to bear away) to keep the rudder balanced.

## 3. Weight Placement
Skipper and crew weight placement is critical and often overlooked.
*   **Fore/Aft Trim:**
    *   *Flat Water:* Move weight **forward**.
    *   *Chop:* Move weight **aft**.
*   **The Indicator:** Watch the "knuckle" on the bow (where the stem meets the bottom). You want it as close to the water as possible without dragging.
*   **Togetherness:** Keep skipper and crew weight close together. This reduces pitching moment, allowing the boat to glide over waves rather than crashing through them.

> [!TIP]
> **Experiment:** Try moving your weight radically forward and aft to feel the difference. Finding the "groove" takes practice, but the speed reward is worth it.
