# Be Patient Going Downhill

**By Stan Schreyer**

Big gains can be made sailing downwind, but big losses happen just as easily. Rarely does one benefit from taking a massive risk on a downwind leg. Instead, smart sailors make gains by capitalizing on the mistakes of others. Here are some reminders to help you sail conservatively while moving up the fleet.

## On the Reaches

### 1. Sail the Shortest Distance
It sounds simple, but in the heat of battle, we often forget.
*   **The Race Against Time:** Racing strategy is defined as the course you would sail if no other boats were on the course.
*   **Don't Panic:** When behind, avoid the temptation to do the opposite of the boats ahead just to split. This usually increases the distance you sail.
*   **Rhumbline:** On a reach, the straight line is usually the fastest path.

### 2. Look for the Puffs
*   **Lulls:** Sail slightly higher than normal to reach the next puff.
*   **Puffs:** Once in the pressure, ride it down to (or below) the rhumbline with increased speed.

### 3. Sail for Clear Air
*   **Wind Shadow:** Every moment you sail in bad air, you lose ground.
*   **Avoid Luffing Matches:** Don't get into unnecessary battles. They cost you time and allow the rest of the fleet to catch up. Think of other boats as roadblocks in your race against time.

### 4. Managing the Pack
Before rounding the windward mark, assess the situation:
*   **Pack Behind? Get High.** Do not turn immediately down to the mark. Reach a bit higher for a boat length or two to signal that you will defend your lane. If you get rolled by one boat, the whole train will follow.
*   **Pack Ahead? Go Low.** This is a golden opportunity. Boats ahead will be forced high to defend their air. Take the low road (rhumbline), stay patient, and watch them sail extra distance while you cut the corner.

### 5. The Outside Rounding
In big fleets, the inside at the leeward mark isn't always best.
*   **Traffic Jams:** Large packs slow down significantly at the mark.
*   **The Move:** Consider rounding on the outside. Keep your speed up, sail around the chaos, and immediately look for a clear lane to tack into.

## On the Run

### 1. Clear Lanes are Mandatory
Sailing in bad air on a reach is sometimes unavoidable. On a run, it is inexcusable. You have the freedom to spread out laterally—use it.

### 2. Sail the Proper Angle
*   **Shroud Telltales:** Put telltales on your shrouds. The windward telltale should always point slightly inboard (indicating flow over the windward quarter).
*   **Don't Sail By the Lee:** In a two-sail boat like the V15, sailing by the lee causes the main to blanket the jib, killing your power. If you find yourself by the lee, either head up or gybe.

### 3. Don't Be Afraid to Gybe
There are three good reasons to gybe:
1.  **Clear Air:** To escape a wind shadow.
2.  **Pressure:** To reach a puff on the other side of the course.
3.  **Angle:** If the other gybe takes you closer to the mark.

Don't get complacent on the "starboard tack train." If a puff appears on the left, gybe for it. If your boat handling makes you hesitate, practice until the loss from a gybe is negligible.
