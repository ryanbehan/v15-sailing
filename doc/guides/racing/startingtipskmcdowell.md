# Starting Line Strategy

**By Katie McDowell**

Preparation for a start in a large fleet can be daunting. With 60+ boats on the line, winning the start isn't just about luck—it's about a series of calculated decisions made long before the gun goes off.

## 1. Pre-Race Preparation
Don't just chat on the sail out to the course. Use this time to gather data.
*   **Tune Up:** Adjust hiking straps, boom vang, and jib tension. Test how the boat responds to different degrees of heel in the current chop.
*   **Weather Intel:** Look at the clouds and discuss the forecast. Is the breeze oscillating or persistently shifting?
*   **Course Scan:** Stand up and look upwind. Are there color or texture differences on the water? Check flags on shore or the lay of the land for geographic shift clues.

## 2. Picking Your Spot
Position is everything.
*   **Favored End:** Go head-to-wind in the middle of the line. Whichever end your bow points closer to is favored. Check this multiple times during the sequence as the wind shifts.
*   **Strategy:** Decide if you want to start at the boat, the pin, or somewhere in the middle based on the favored end and your plan for the first leg.

## 3. The Approach
*   **Starboard Approach:** Requires good boat handling. You'll be perched on the line longer and forced to defend against more boats, but you have right-of-way.
*   **Port Approach:** Risky but can yield a great hole if timed right. Choose the boat you tack under carefully and ensure you leave a sizable gap to leeward.

## 4. Defending Your Hole
Once you're set up, you must defend your space from poachers.
*   **The Defense Move:** If someone tries to sail into your hole from leeward or astern:
    1.  **Bear Down:** Aggressively point your bow at them.
    2.  **Luff Main, Trim Jib:** This kills forward speed but rotates the bow down.
    3.  **The Pounce:** As soon as the threat is gone, luff the jib and trim the main to catapult the bow back up to windward.
*   **Awareness:** Stay vigilant. You are vulnerable while parked.

## 5. The Final Countdown
*   **30 Seconds:** Look for latecomers trying to poach. Look ahead to the line to gauge distance.
*   **10 Seconds:** Grab the mainsheet. Gauge your distance—are you one boat length back? Two?
*   **The Acceleration:**
    1.  **Bear Away:** Slowly pull the tiller and have the crew trim the jib to turn the boat down and build speed.
    2.  **3 Seconds:** Heel the boat to leeward to initiate a rock. Move in tandem with your crew for a smooth motion.
    3.  **The Gun:** Flatten the boat aggressively, head up, and **hike, hike, hike**.

If you execute these steps, you'll punch out off the line with clear air and speed, making the race yours to lose.
