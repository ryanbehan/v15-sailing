# Vanguard 15 Hull Reinforcements

Over the years, the construction of the Vanguard 15 has evolved to improve durability and longevity. If you are looking at older boats or considering upgrades, it's helpful to understand these changes.

## Key Structural Improvements
*   **Plexus Bonding:** Newer boats use Plexus (a high-strength methacrylate adhesive) for all structural bonds, significantly increasing hull stiffness and integrity.
*   **Mainsheet Eyestrap:** A metal backing plate with tapped fasteners replaced the original wood-block system for the mainsheet ratchet eyestrap. This eliminates the common "soft floor" issue caused by rotting wood.
*   **Stringer Reinforcements:** Additional reinforcements were added to the hull stringers to prevent cracking and fatigue.
*   **Spreader Length:** The class rule shortened spreaders from 16" to 14". This reduces the leverage the rig exerts on the hull, decreasing the risk of structural damage from extreme rig tension.

## Warranty Note
If you suspect a structural issue that might be covered under warranty, always contact your Vanguard 15 dealer first for the best resolution.
