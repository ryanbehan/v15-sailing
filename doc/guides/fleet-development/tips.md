# Building a Strong Fleet

**By Nick Adamson, Fleet 53**

Before embarking on an effort to develop a fleet in your area, you need to ask two fundamental questions:
1.  **Is there a void?** Is there a lack of a strong double-handed dinghy fleet to compete against in your area?
2.  **Is there interest?** Are there enough people interested in this type of sailing to make it worthwhile?

These are crucial questions to answer before investing time and money. Fortunately for V15 enthusiasts, the answer is often a resounding "Yes."

Here are the key pillars of successful fleet development:

## 1. Seeding the Fleet
If you're starting from scratch or with very few boats, you need to generate buzz.
*   **Target Number:** Aim for 8 to 10 boats to establish a critical mass for long-term success.
*   **Outreach:** Call sailing buddies, post on yacht club bulletin boards, and talk it up at local regattas.
*   **Momentum:** People are often interested but need a group effort to commit. Be the catalyst.

## 2. A Place to Call Home
A central location with a good sailing venue is vital.
*   **Convenience:** Sailors prefer leaving their boats at the site to minimize transportation hassle.
*   **Partnerships:** Negotiate with a local Yacht Club or community sailing center for storage and access. Removing barriers to entry helps membership grow.

## 3. Fleet Hierarchy: Spreading the Load
Don't try to do it all yourself. A well-organized structure keeps the fleet running smoothly.
*   **Roles:** Identify key areas like regatta organization, funding, social activities, and recruiting.
*   **Delegation:** Assign specific people to these roles to ensure proactive management.
*   **Sustainability:** Sharing the workload prevents burnout and keeps motivation high.

## 4. Communication is Key
In the digital age, effective communication is easier than ever but still requires effort.
*   **Web Presence:** Maintain a website with schedules, contacts, and helpful info.
*   **Listserv/Forum:** Use email lists or forums to facilitate quick communication among fleet members. Set these up early!

## 5. Regatta Schedule: Mix It Up
The V15 is fun, versatile, and portable. Your schedule should reflect that.
*   **Variety:** Mix fleet racing with team racing, long-distance courses, and short-course formats.
*   **Venues:** While a home base is important, travelling to different venues adds excitement.
*   **Creativity:** Try camping regattas or mixed-sport events to keep things fresh.

## 6. Everyone is a Recruiter
Fleet development never truly ends. A fleet that stops growing starts shrinking.
*   **Culture of Recruitment:** Encourage every member to act as a recruiter.
*   **Loaner Boats:** Make it a policy to loan boats to prospects if an owner can't sail.
*   **Prospect Regattas:** Hold A/B division events where owners bring new sailors to crew or skipper.
