# Mainsheet Trim: Angle of Attack vs. Leech Tension

**By Dave Kirkpatrick**

One of the fundamental concepts of mainsail trim is the distinction between **leech tension** and **angle of attack**. Understanding how to manipulate these two variables is key to boat speed in all conditions.

## The Concept
Imagine a boat with both a mainsheet and a traveler:
*   **Traveler:** Controls the **angle of attack** (how close the boom is to the centerline).
*   **Mainsheet:** Controls **leech tension** (pulling the boom down).

In a boat like the Vanguard 15, which lacks a traveler, we must use other controls—specifically the **vang**—to achieve similar effects.

## Light Air: Powering Up
In light air, your goal is to generate power.
*   **Technique:** Sail with a loose vang.
*   **Effect:** When you ease the mainsheet, the boom rises. This decreases leech tension, twists the sail, and makes it fuller.
*   **Result:** The sail powers up, helping you punch through lulls and chop.

## Heavy Air: Vang Sheeting
In heavy breeze, your goal is to depower while maintaining a flat, efficient sail shape.
*   **Technique:** Pull the vang on hard ("vang sheeting").
*   **Effect:** The tight vang takes over the job of controlling leech tension. When you ease the mainsheet, the boom goes **out** (changing angle of attack) rather than **up**.
*   **Result:** You spill wind to keep the boat flat without losing the leech tension that drives the boat forward. This is critical for pointing and speed in big breeze.

## Summary
*   **Mainsheet:** Primary control for angle of attack (in/out) when vang is on.
*   **Vang:** Primary control for leech tension (up/down) in heavy air.

Mastering this interplay allows you to shift gears seamlessly as conditions change.
