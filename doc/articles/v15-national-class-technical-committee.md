# Technical Committee

**By V15 Class Association**

The Technical Committee is responsible for interpreting the Class Rules and maintaining the strict one-design nature of the Vanguard 15.

## Role of the Committee

The Technical Committee reviews proposed rule changes and questions regarding the legality of rigging and modifications. Their primary goal is to ensure that the Vanguard 15 remains a sailor-vs-sailor competition, rather than a checkbook-vs-checkbook one.

> [!NOTE]
> **One-Design Philosophy:** The Vanguard 15 is a STRICT one-design class. A good rule of thumb is: if the rules don't say you CAN do it, odds are you CAN'T.

## Historical Rule Changes & Interpretations

Over the years, the committee has addressed various issues to improve safety or correct design flaws.

*   **Sta-Master Adjusters:** Evaluated to make shroud adjustment safer.
*   **Spreader Length:** Adjustments were made to correct flaws in the original design.
*   **2:1 Jib Sheeting:** Clarified as not allowed under standard rules at the time of review.

### Process
Proposed rule changes are typically reviewed by the committee, who may consult with class members before making a recommendation to the Class Officers for adoption.

*For specific questions about legality or to propose a change, please contact the current Class Officers.*
