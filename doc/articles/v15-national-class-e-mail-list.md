# Stay Connected

**By V15 Class Association**

Communication is the lifeblood of any one-design class. While the methods have evolved over the years, the need to share tuning tips, regatta schedules, and stories remains the same.

> [!NOTE]
> **Historical Note:** Long-time V15 sailors may remember the "Topica" email list. This list is no longer active. Please use the resources below to connect with the class today.

## Online Forums

For technical questions, boat sales, and general discussion, the following forums are active hubs for V15 sailors:

*   **[Sailboat Owners V15 Forum](https://forums.sailboatowners.com/forums/vanguard-15.123/)**: A dedicated section for Vanguard 15 specific discussions.
*   **[Sailing Anarchy Dinghy Anarchy](https://forums.sailinganarchy.com/forums/dinghy-anarchy.1/)**: While not V15-exclusive, this is a high-traffic forum where V15 topics often appear. Search for "Vanguard 15" or "V15".

## Local Fleet Lists

Most active racing happens at the fleet level. Many fleets maintain their own email lists, Google Groups, or WhatsApp chats for organizing local practice and racing.

If you are looking to join the fun, your best bet is to reach out to a local fleet captain.

*   **[Chicago Corinthian Yacht Club (Fleet 80)](https://www.corinthian.org/)**
*   **[Cedar Point Yacht Club](https://www.cedarpointyc.org/)**
*   **[Willamette Sailing Club](https://willamettesailingclub.com/)**

*Check our [Clubs & Fleets](/clubs/clubs) page for a more comprehensive list of active locations.*

## Social Media

Many fleets have active Facebook groups or Instagram pages. Searching for "Vanguard 15 [Your City]" is often the quickest way to find the local crowd.
